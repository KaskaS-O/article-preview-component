## Overview

### The challenge

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Different layouts for mobile and desktop active states were a challenge, but I figured out the way to build them. This project was a great opportunity to pracitice CSS grid and face the problems connected.

### Continued development

I'd like to focus on js and make my code cleaner. I could use a flag to toggle between active and not active states, what probably would allow me to reduce to one function.
